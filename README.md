# This is a Read Me File. I know because the file is titled README.

## The Challenge

"Create a README.md file in your git-practice folder. In the file, using your text editor, add a heading and a description. Save, stage, commit, and push your new README.md file to GitHub."

### I was successful! 

- I made a file using the *touch* command.  
- I opened the file in my text editor, *Visual Studio Code* , horay! 
- I have made a heading, and a description, which I cleverly copy and pasted! 

#### Next Step: Commit, **I don't know if I am ready for a commitment**.
